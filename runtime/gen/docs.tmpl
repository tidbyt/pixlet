# Widgets!

Pixlet comes with a number of built-in _Widgets_. These are used to
describe how data should be laid out, presented and finally rendered
to an image file.

The easiest way to get started is probably to take a look at some of
the [examples](../examples/), and then refer to the detailed Widget
documentation (this document) when the need arises.

{{range .}}{{$widgetName := .Name}}
## {{.Name}}
{{.Documentation}}

#### Attributes
| Name | Type | Description | Required |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
{{range .AttrAll -}}
| `{{.Starlark}}` | `{{.Type}}` | {{.Documentation}} | {{if .Required}}**Y**{{else}}N{{end}} |
{{end}}
{{range $i, $code := .Examples -}}
#### Example
```
{{$code}}
```
![](img/widget_{{$widgetName}}_{{$i}}.webp)
{{end}}
{{end}}
