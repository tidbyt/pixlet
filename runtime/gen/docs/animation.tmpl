# Animations!

Pixlet supports a few animation primitives. These are used to animate
widgets from frame to frame.

All animations allow specifying an easing curve. This can either be one
of the built-in "linear", "ease_in", "ease_out" or "ease_in_out" curves,
a custom cubic b√©zier curve in the form "cubic-bezier(a, b, c, d)" or a
custom easing function.

**Warning**: The animation module is in a state of flux. Especially
`Transformation` and related classes are likely to change in the near
term. Please be on the lookout for bugs, issues and potential
improvements!
