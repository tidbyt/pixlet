# Widgets!

Pixlet comes with a number of built-in _Widgets_. These are used to
describe how data should be laid out, presented and finally rendered
to an image file.

The easiest way to get started is probably to take a look at some of
the [examples](../examples/), and then refer to the detailed Widget
documentation (this document) when the need arises.

A quick note about colors.  When specifying colors, use a CSS-like
hexdecimal color specification.  Pixlet supports "#rgb", "#rrggbb",
"#rgba", and "#rrggbbaa" color specifications.

For animated widgets like Marquee, you can also call `frame_count()`
to work out how many frames are required to display the whole
animation. You can also call `size()` on dynamically-sized widgets
like Text to get the width and height.
